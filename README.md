HierarchyTableView-Swift
========================

This swift project shows a simple implementation of a hierarchy table view containing different types of objects using the swift language.
This table view contains two types of object : Normal and Leaf.
The hierarchy cells are selectables. Each time a cell is selected, the right view change, depending on the type of the object chosen, and the object itself (green for leaf, brown for normal, and the title is updated based on the name of the object).
All the view was realized with a storyboard.
